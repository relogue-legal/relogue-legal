        </ul>

            <li><strong>Premium Subscribers:</strong> Limited to 5 affirmation creations per day. The free generation does not count toward this daily limit. The daily limit resets at midnight UTC.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rate limits are enforced per device using an anonymous device identifier. Attempting to circumvent rate limits may result in service suspension.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Rate limits apply to the creation of new affirmations only. Playing, replaying, and listening to existing affirmations is unlimited for all users.
