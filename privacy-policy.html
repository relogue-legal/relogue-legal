        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 3, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to Relogue ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we collect, use, and safeguard your information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the Relogue mobile application ("App").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #915c3d;">Personal Information</h3>

            <li><strong>Apple ID Information:</strong> If you sign in with Apple, we receive your Apple ID identifier and, if you choose to share it, your email address. Apple may provide a private relay email address to protect your actual email.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #915c3d;">Usage Data</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Listening time and session duration</li>
            <li>Streak and goal completion data</li>
            <li>Affirmation preferences and selections</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> We do NOT collect sensitive personal data such as your location, contacts, photos, health data, or financial information.
        </div>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your information is used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Your first name may be used in AI-generated affirmations to create a more personal experience. You can disable this feature in Settings.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Content Generation:</strong> Your selected preferences (intention, voice choice, and questionnaire responses) are sent to our AI service to generate personalized affirmation scripts. This data does not include any personally identifiable information beyond your first name (if enabled).</li>
            <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> Anonymous usage statistics help us understand how users interact with the app and improve our features.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> To manage your subscription and sync your data across devices (if signed in).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>Relogue uses artificial intelligence to create personalized affirmation scripts. Here's what you should know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your questionnaire responses and preferences are sent to our secure AI processing service.</li>
            <li>If you enable name personalization, your first name is included in the AI prompt to generate personalized content.</li>
            <li>We do not store the raw AI prompts or responses beyond what is necessary to deliver your affirmations.</li>
            <li>AI-generated content is created fresh for each request and is unique to your selections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>We take your data security seriously:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your affirmations and preferences are stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li>If you sign in with Apple, your data may be synced to our secure cloud servers.</li>
            <li>All data transmission uses industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS).</li>
            <li>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your data as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Stored on your device until you delete the app or clear app data.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Retained while your account is active. You can request deletion at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Generated Content Logs:</strong> For content safety, abuse prevention, and service improvement, we retain AI-generated affirmation scripts on our servers. This data is associated with a pseudonymous device identifier (not your name or personal identity) and is used solely to monitor for harmful content, prevent misuse, and improve our AI systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Engagement Statistics:</strong> We collect aggregated, pseudonymous usage statistics (listening time, streaks) to understand user engagement and improve the app experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Why we retain AI outputs:</strong> As a responsible AI service provider, we maintain logs of AI-generated content to ensure our systems do not produce harmful or inappropriate material. This is an industry-standard practice for AI safety and is not used for advertising or marketing purposes.
        </div>

        <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name Personalization:</strong> Toggle off "Personalise Affirmations" in Settings to prevent your name from being used in AI-generated content.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can clear your listening history in Settings. To delete all account data, contact us at support@relogue.app.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You can request complete account deletion by contacting our support team.</li>
